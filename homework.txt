The system should provied a possibility to:
- create a new user
- add records to statistics-service
- show total statistics per user
- show average sum spent during the period of time (like 2 last days)
- show the most expensive purchase 
- show user info 


Requirements:
All configurations from all servers should be stored in configuration files in config-service.
Google how to prevent the server startup if the config-service is down! The system should now start if there is no config-service.

gateway-service receives all the requests from Postman. 
gateway-service has to validate the request body before process the requests within the system. Use
hibernate-validator in order to validate the request body.

account-service user should contain more info about the user, like his/her email address, date of birth and so on.
Using Rest Repositories and Zuul (gateway-service), implement the user search by parameters, like,
age, email address, last name.
Search should be accesible via gateway-service (gateway-service may contain a map of methods, you 
may call in account-service).

No request, but user creation and user search should be processed without userId.

There is an advanced part of the homework, including creation of another login-service and spring-security on gateway level.

Good luck!
